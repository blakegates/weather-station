1. Install Raspberry Pi OS
  1. I'm running Raspberry Pi OS headless on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2WH
2. Update system
  1. sudo apt-get update
  2. sudo apt-get upgrade
  3. reboot

3. Enable I2C interface
  1. open terminal on Raspberry Pi
  2. sudo raspi-config
  3. navigate to 'Interface Options'
  4. select I2C, enable, confirm
  5. select finish to exit
  6. reboot

4. Verify I2C
  1. confirm i2c-tools is installed (this should be but good to check)
    1. sudo apt-get update
    2. sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
  2. confirm i2c interface (or sensor) can be detected
    1. sudo i2cdetect -y 1
    2. expect to see 0x77 or 0x76 as the output (default address for BME680)

5. Install Adafruit BME680 library
  1. To simplify interaction with the BME680 sensor in Python, I'm installing the Adafruit CircuitPython BME680 library. It takes out the complexities of low-level I2C communication, and focuses on data interpretation.
  2. I won't be following the rules and running this in a VENV. Not advised, but it's my shit and I do what I want lol
    1. Straight deleting the file that gives an error
