Using the Adafruit STEMMA QT connectors to prevent soldering

BME680 VIN (Red wire on STEMMA QT) to Raspberry Pi 3.3V Power (Pin 1 or 17)
BME680 GND (Black wire on STEMMA QT) to Raspberry Pi GND (e.g., Pin 6)
BME680 SDA (Blue wire on STEMMA QT) to Raspberry Pi SDA (Pin 3)
BME680 SCL (Yellow wire on STEMMA QT) to Raspberry Pi SCL (Pin 5)



The BME680 sensor communicates with the Raspberry Pi using the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol. I2C is a widely adopted two-wire serial bus that facilitates communication between multiple devices and a single master, in this case, the Raspberry Pi. This protocol requires only two primary data lines: SDA (Serial Data Line) for transmitting and receiving data, and SCL (Serial Clock Line) for synchronizing data transfer. Additionally, power (VCC/VIN) and ground (GND) connections are necessary for the sensor's operation.
